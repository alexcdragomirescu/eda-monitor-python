EDA Monitor

# Description
This is a program to generate a summary of commands for EDA. It uses the script 
`proclog-admin-tool.sh` to export data from its database. The output is in XML 
but uses `CSV` as the enclosing format.
Output files are in the form of 
`proclog_<YYYY-MM-DD>_<HH.MM.SS.MSEC>_<SEQ_NR>.csv.gz`. In other words, 
`proclog_2021-08-10_00.00.01.799_1.csv.gz`.

# 


# Environment
The code was written in Python, version 2.6.
